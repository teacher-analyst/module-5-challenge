# module-5-challenge

My code for module 5 submission can be found in the file 'pymaceuticals_starter.ppynb'.
The file begins with an analysis of the study results. Followed by the following sections: 
- Beginning: ending with the number of mice in the cleaned_df
- Summary statistics: ending with summary table created with the aggregation method
- Bar and pie charts: ending with a pie chart
- Quartiles, outliers & boxplots: ending with a scatter plot and linear regression model
  
All sections were completed by refering to class activities and/or with assitance from AskBCS
